# Hercules project

## Purpose

Hercules aims to be the state of the art bot. Leveraging cloud infrastructure to impact popular news sources.

It's responsibility can be captured in three bullet points:
* The crawler reads popular forums and remembers all the relevant information. It does so using the power of distributed network of CPUs (processing units). The data collected is then fed to some data store where it rests until the classifier comes in and picks it up.
* The classifier checks what is available in the data store and crunches the data to find out _interesting_ things. For instance, you can check how many people are talking about Assassin's Creed everyday. After crunching, the data is fed to the poster.
* The poster knows what to reply to which class of comments.
